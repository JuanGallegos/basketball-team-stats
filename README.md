# Basketball Team Stats Tool
This project reads from the "constants" data (`PLAYERS` and `TEAMS`) in `constants.py` without modifying the original data. The program requires that the players are selected at random and assigned to a team, that each team have the same amount of inexperienced and experienced players, and that basic stats are provided for the team.
